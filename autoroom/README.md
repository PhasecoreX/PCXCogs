# AutoRoom Instructions
Use [p]bancheckset autocheck set to set the channel that autocheck results go to, then you need to enable services with [p]bancheckset service

[p]bancheckset settings will give you an overview of what's enabled and not.

KSoft.Si is a bot-wide key (all servers the bot is in, instead of a single server) those services can be enabled or disabled with [p]banchecksetglobal for the entire bot, and then each server owner can enable or disable KSoft.Si checking for their own server. All the other ones so far are server specific keys, so the server owners set that up themselves.
